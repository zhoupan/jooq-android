/**
 * A row value expression.
 *
 * <p>Row value expressions are mainly useful for use in predicates, when comparing several values
 * in one go, which can be more elegant than expanding the row value expression predicate in other
 * equivalent syntaxes. This is especially true for non-equality predicates. For instance, the
 * following two predicates are equivalent in SQL:
 *
 * <p><code><pre>
 * (A, B) &gt; (X, Y)
 * (A &gt; X) OR (A = X AND B &gt; Y)
 * </pre></code>
 *
 * <p><strong>Example:</strong>
 *
 * <p><code><pre>
 * // Assuming import static org.jooq.impl.DSL.*;
 *
 * using(configuration)
 *    .select()
 *    .from(CUSTOMER)
 *    .where(row(CUSTOMER.FIRST_NAME, CUSTOMER.LAST_NAME).in(
 *        select(ACTOR.FIRST_NAME, ACTOR.LAST_NAME).from(ACTOR)
 *    ))
 *    .fetch();
 * </pre></code>
 *
 * <p>Note: Not all databases support row value expressions, but many row value expression
 * operations can be emulated on all databases. See relevant row value expression method Javadocs
 * for details.
 *
 * <p>Instances can be created using {@link DSL#row(Object...)} and overloads.
