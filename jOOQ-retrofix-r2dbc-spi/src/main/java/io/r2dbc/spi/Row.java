/**
 * Represents a row returned from a database query. Values from columns can be either retrieved by
 * specifying a column name or the column index. Column indexes are {@code 0}-based. Column names do
 * not necessarily reflect the column names how they are in the underlying tables but rather how
 * columns are represented (e.g. aliased) in the result.
 *
 * <p>Column names used as input to getter methods are case insensitive. When a get method is called
 * with a column name and several columns have the same name, then the value of the first matching
 * column will be returned. The column name option is designed to be used when column names are used
 * in the SQL query that generated the result set. Columns that are not explicitly named in the
 * query should be referenced through column indexes.
 *
 * <p>For maximum portability, result columns within each {@link Row} should be read in
 * left-to-right order, and each column should be read only once.
 *
 * <p>{@link #get(String)} and {@link #get(int)} without specifying a target type returns a suitable
 * value representation. The R2DBC specification contains a mapping table that shows default
 * mappings between database types and Java types. Specifying a target type, the R2DBC driver
 * attempts to convert the value to the target type.
 *
 * <p>A row is invalidated after consumption in the {@link Result#map(BiFunction) mapping function}.
 *
 * <p>The number, type and characteristics of columns are described through {@link RowMetadata}
